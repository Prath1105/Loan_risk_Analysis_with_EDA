# Loan_risk_Analysis_with_EDA

## Introduction
This assignment explores the application of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in a real-world business scenario. It focuses on risk analytics in banking and financial services, aiming to understand how data can help minimize the risk of financial loss when lending to customers.

## Business Understanding
Loan providers often struggle to approve loans due to applicants' insufficient or non-existent credit histories. Some individuals exploit this by defaulting on loans. In this project, we analyze loan data to identify patterns that indicate an applicant’s likelihood of repaying the loan. 

When a company receives a loan application, it faces two risks:
1. **Rejecting a worthy applicant** (lost business opportunity).
2. **Approving a risky applicant** (potential financial loss).

The dataset includes two types of scenarios:
- Clients with payment difficulties (late payments beyond a threshold).
- Clients who made timely payments.

## Loan Application Decisions
Applicants and financial institutions can take four possible actions regarding loans:
- **Approved**: Loan is granted.
- **Cancelled**: Applicant cancels the loan process.
- **Refused**: Loan is denied due to risk assessment.
- **Unused Offer**: Loan offer is canceled by the applicant at different stages.

## Business Objectives
This study aims to identify indicators of loan default, helping lenders make data-driven decisions such as:
- Rejecting risky applicants.
- Adjusting loan amounts.
- Charging higher interest rates for high-risk applicants.

Understanding the driving factors behind defaults allows banks to optimize their portfolio and risk assessment strategies.
